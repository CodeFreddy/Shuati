# 375. Guess Number Higher or Lower II

We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from **1** to **n**. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower.

However, when you guess a particular number x, and you guess wrong, you pay **$x**. You win the game when you guess the number I picked.

**Example:**

```text
n = 10, I pick 8.

First round:  You guess 5, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $5.
Second round: You guess 7, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $7.
Third round:  You guess 9, I tell you that it's lower. You pay $9.

Game over. 8 is the number I picked.

You end up paying $5 + $7 + $9 = $21.
```

Given a particular **n ≥ 1**, find out how much money you need to have to guarantee a **win**.

这是一道极大值极小值问题， 该问题的参考链接:

这道题就是假设对方决策完美的情况下 我们最小损失是多少。

dp\[i\]\[j\]表示的就是i - j范围内选择一个数的最小损失。

cost\_x = x + max{dp\[i\]\[x - 1\], dp\[x+1\]\[j\]}; 找最大值是因为不管你如何选择数， feedback都是往最坏的那个方向走。

 then we get DP\(\[i~j\]\) = **min**{xi, ... ,xj}  
--&gt; _// this min makes sure that you are minimizing your cost._

```java
class Solution {
    public int getMoneyAmount(int n) {
       int[][] table = new int[n+1][n+1];
        return DP(table, 1, n);
        
    }
    
    
    // x between [i,j] -> cost_x = x + max{DP(i, x-1), DP(x+1, j)}
    public int DP(int[][]table, int left, int right)
    {
        if(left >= right) return 0;
        if(table[left][right] != 0) return table[left][right];
        
        int res = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for(int x = left; x < right; x++)
        {
            int tmp = x + Math.max(DP(table, left, x-1), DP(table, x+1, right));
            res = Math.min(res, tmp);
        }
        table[left][right] = res;
        return res;
    }
}
