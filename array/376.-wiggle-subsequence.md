# 376. Wiggle Subsequence

A sequence of numbers is called a **wiggle sequence** if the differences between successive numbers strictly alternate between positive and negative. The first difference \(if one exists\) may be either positive or negative. A sequence with fewer than two elements is trivially a wiggle sequence.

For example, `[1,7,4,9,2,5]` is a wiggle sequence because the differences `(6,-3,5,-7,3)` are alternately positive and negative. In contrast, `[1,4,7,2,5]` and `[1,7,4,5,5]` are not wiggle sequences, the first because its first two differences are positive and the second because its last difference is zero.

Given a sequence of integers, return the length of the longest subsequence that is a wiggle sequence. A subsequence is obtained by deleting some number of elements \(eventually, also zero\) from the original sequence, leaving the remaining elements in their original order.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: [1,7,4,9,2,5]
Output: 6
Explanation: The entire sequence is a wiggle sequence.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: [1,17,5,10,13,15,10,5,16,8]
Output: 7
Explanation: There are several subsequences that achieve this length. One is [1,17,10,13,10,16,8].
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
Output: 2
```

这道题 利用dp的思想去做 每一个点只有三种状态 

* up position, it means nums\[i\] &gt; nums\[i-1\]
* down position, it means nums\[i\] &lt; nums\[i-1\]
* equals to position, nums\[i\] == nums\[i-1\]

 So we can use two arrays up\[\] and down\[\] to record _the max wiggle sequence length so far_ at index _**i**_. 这里up和down表示的是 到i这个位置 前面end在up point的最大sequence的长度， down表示的是到i这个位置时 ，之前end 到down point的最大sequence长度。

为什么可以只根据和前一个数的比较得到这个点是up 还是down point呢？ 因为如果nums\[i\] &gt; nums\[i-1\] 说明不管nums\[i-1\] 前面的数情况如何 在nums\[i-1\]到nums\[i\]的时候 肯定是up的。 同理小于也是一样。

If nums\[i\] &gt; nums\[i-1\], that means it wiggles up. the element before it must be a down position. so up\[i\] = down\[i-1\] + 1; down\[i\] keeps the same with before. 

If nums\[i\] &lt; nums\[i-1\], that means it wiggles down. the element before it must be a up position. so down\[i\] = up\[i-1\] + 1; up\[i\] keeps the same with before. 

If nums\[i\] == nums\[i-1\], that means it will not change anything becasue it didn't wiggle at all. so both down\[i\] and up\[i\] keep the same.

```java
class Solution {
    public int wiggleMaxLength(int[] nums) {
        if(nums == null || nums.length == 0) return 0;
        int[] up = new int[nums.length];
        int[] down = new int[nums.length];
        up[0] = 1;
        down[0] = 1;
        for(int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++)
        {
            if(nums[i] > nums[i-1]) // means this point is an up point
            {
                up[i] = down[i-1] + 1;
                down[i] = down[i-1];
            }else if(nums[i] < nums[i-1]) // means this point is a down point
            {
                down[i] = up[i-1] + 1;
                up[i] = up[i-1];
            
            }else
            {
                up[i] = up[i-1];
                down[i] = down[i-1];
            }
        }
        return Math.max(up[nums.length-1], down[nums.length-1]);
    }
}
```

    public int wiggleMaxLength(int[] nums) {
        if(nums == null || nums.length == 0) return 0;
        int up = 1;
        int down = 1;

            {
                up = down + 1;
            }else if(nums[i] < nums[i-1])
            {
                down = up + 1;
