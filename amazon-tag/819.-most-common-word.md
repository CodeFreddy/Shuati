# 819. Most Common Word



Given a paragraph and a list of banned words, return the most frequent word that is not in the list of banned words.  It is guaranteed there is at least one word that isn't banned, and that the answer is unique.

Words in the list of banned words are given in lowercase, and free of punctuation.  Words in the paragraph are not case sensitive.  The answer is in lowercase.

**Example:**

```text
Input: 
paragraph = "Bob hit a ball, the hit BALL flew far after it was hit."
banned = ["hit"]
Output: "ball"
Explanation: 
"hit" occurs 3 times, but it is a banned word.
"ball" occurs twice (and no other word does), so it is the most frequent non-banned word in the paragraph. 
Note that words in the paragraph are not case sensitive,
that punctuation is ignored (even if adjacent to words, such as "ball,"), 
and that "hit" isn't the answer even though it occurs more because it is banned.
```

**Note:**

* `1 <= paragraph.length <= 1000`.
* `0 <= banned.length <= 100`.
* `1 <= banned[i].length <= 10`.
* The answer is unique, and written in lowercase \(even if its occurrences in `paragraph` may have uppercase symbols, and even if it is a proper noun.\)
* `paragraph` only consists of letters, spaces, or the punctuation symbols `!?',;.`
* There are no hyphens or hyphenated words.
* Words only consist of letters, never apostrophes or other punctuation symbols.
* 


4 steps:

1. remove all punctuations
2. change to lowercase
3. words count for each word not in banned set
4. return the most common word

```java
class Solution {
    public String mostCommonWord(String paragraph, String[] banned) {
        String[] words = paragraph.toLowerCase().split("\\W+");
        Set<String> banSet = new HashSet<>();
        for(String str: banned){
            banSet.add(str);
        }
        
        HashMap<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for(String s: words){
            if(!banSet.contains(s)){
                map.put(s, map.getOrDefault(s, 0) + 1);
            }
        }
        int max = 0;
        String res = "";
        for(String s: map.keySet()){
            if(map.get(s) > max){
                max = map.get(s);
                res = s;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

解法2：

```java
class Solution {
    public String mostCommonWord(String paragraph, String[] banned) {
        paragraph += ".";

        Set<String> banset = new HashSet();
        for (String word: banned) banset.add(word);
        Map<String, Integer> count = new HashMap();

        String ans = "";
        int ansfreq = 0;

        StringBuilder word = new StringBuilder();
        for (char c: paragraph.toCharArray()) {
            if (Character.isLetter(c)) {
                word.append(Character.toLowerCase(c));
            } else if (word.length() > 0) {
                String finalword = word.toString();
                if (!banset.contains(finalword)) {
                    count.put(finalword, count.getOrDefault(finalword, 0) + 1);
                    if (count.get(finalword) > ansfreq) {
                        ans = finalword;
                        ansfreq = count.get(finalword);
                    }
                }
                word = new StringBuilder();
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
}
```

时间复杂度均为O\(n\) n为paragraph的长度。空间复杂度为O\(m\) m为HashMap里元素的个数和banned array里较大的那一个。
