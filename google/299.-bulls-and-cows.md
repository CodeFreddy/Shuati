# 299. Bulls and Cows

You are playing the following [Bulls and Cows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulls_and_Cows) game with your friend: You write down a number and ask your friend to guess what the number is. Each time your friend makes a guess, you provide a hint that indicates how many digits in said guess match your secret number exactly in both digit and position \(called "bulls"\) and how many digits match the secret number but locate in the wrong position \(called "cows"\). Your friend will use successive guesses and hints to eventually derive the secret number.

Write a function to return a hint according to the secret number and friend's guess, use `A` to indicate the bulls and `B` to indicate the cows. 

Please note that both secret number and friend's guess may contain duplicate digits.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: secret = "1807", guess = "7810"

Output: "1A3B"

Explanation: 1 bull and 3 cows. The bull is 8, the cows are 0, 1 and 7.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: secret = "1123", guess = "0111"

Output: "1A1B"

Explanation: The 1st 1 in friend's guess is a bull, the 2nd or 3rd 1 is a cow.
```

**Note:** You may assume that the secret number and your friend's guess only contain digits, and their lengths are always equal.

这道题思路是 从头开始比较字符 如果对应位置的数字相同，bulls加1， 设置一个长度为10的array，因为数字只能是0-9，如果secret出现了一个数字，那么就在num\[s\]++, 如果guess先出现一个数字，nums\[g\]--. 这样每次进行判断， 如果nums\[s\] &lt; 0说明这个数字之前在guess出现过， cows++， 如果nums\[g\] &gt; 0， 说明这个数字之前在secret出现过， cows++。

时间复杂度：O\(N\), 空间复杂度：O\(N\)

```java
class Solution {
    public String getHint(String secret, String guess) {
        int bulls = 0;
        int cows = 0;
        int[] nums = new int[10];
        
        for(int i = 0; i < secret.length(); i++)
        {
            int s = secret.charAt(i) - '0';
            int g = guess.charAt(i) - '0';
            if(s == g)
                bulls++;
            else
            {
                if(nums[s] < 0) cows++;
                if(nums[g] > 0) cows++;
                
                nums[s]++;
                nums[g]--;
            }
            
        }
        
        return bulls + "A" + cows + "B";
    }
}
```
