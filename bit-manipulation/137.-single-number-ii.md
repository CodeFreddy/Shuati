# 137. Single Number II



Given a **non-empty** array of integers, every element appears _three_ times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find that single one.

**Note:**

Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: [2,2,3,2]
Output: 3
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]
Output: 99
```

时间复杂度：O\(n\) 空间复杂度： O\(1\)

```java
class Solution {
    public int singleNumber(int[] nums) {
        int a = 0, b =0;
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++)
        {
            b = (b^nums[i]) & ~a;
            a = (a^nums[i]) & ~b;
        }
        return b;
    }
}
```
