# 190. Reverse Bits

Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.

**Example:**

```text
Input: 43261596
Output: 964176192
Explanation: 43261596 represented in binary as 00000010100101000001111010011100, 
             return 964176192 represented in binary as 00111001011110000010100101000000.
```

**Follow up**:  
If this function is called many times, how would you optimize it?  


时间复杂度：O\(1\) 空间复杂度:O\(1\)

```java
public class Solution {
    // you need treat n as an unsigned value
  public int reverseBits(int n) {
    int result = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
        result += n & 1;
        n >>>= 1;   // CATCH: must do unsigned shift
        if (i < 31) // CATCH: for last digit, don't shift!
            result <<= 1;
    }
    return result;
}
}
```
