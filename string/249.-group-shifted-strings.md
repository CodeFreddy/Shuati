# 249. Group Shifted Strings



Given a string, we can "shift" each of its letter to its successive letter, for example: `"abc" -> "bcd"`. We can keep "shifting" which forms the sequence:

```text
"abc" -> "bcd" -> ... -> "xyz"
```

Given a list of strings which contains only lowercase alphabets, group all strings that belong to the same shifting sequence.

**Example:**

```text
Input: ["abc", "bcd", "acef", "xyz", "az", "ba", "a", "z"],
Output: 
[
  ["abc","bcd","xyz"],
  ["az","ba"],
  ["acef"],
  ["a","z"]
]
```

找到第一个字符的偏移量 因为其余字符肯定也是switch相同的步数 所以根据这个偏移量可以将偏移过后的字符串变成最初的字符串 然后以这个字符串作为key 将相同的组的string存入hashmap。

时间复杂度:O\(m\*n\) n为strings中字符串的个数 m为每个字符串的长度 空间复杂度:O\(n\)
