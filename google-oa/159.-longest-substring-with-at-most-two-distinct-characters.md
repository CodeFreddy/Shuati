# 159. Longest Substring with At Most Two Distinct Characters



Given a string _**s**_ , find the length of the longest substring _**t**_  that contains **at most** 2 distinct characters.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: "eceba"
Output: 3
Explanation: t is "ece" which its length is 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: "ccaabbb"
Output: 5
Explanation: t is "aabbb" which its length is 5.
```

 The main idea is to maintain a sliding window with 2 unique characters. The key is to store the last occurrence of each character as the value in the hashmap. This way, whenever the size of the hashmap exceeds 2, we can traverse through the map to find the character with the left most index, and remove 1 character from our map. Since the range of characters is constrained, we should be able to find the left most index in constant time.

```java
class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLongestSubstringTwoDistinct(String s) {
        if(s.length() < 1) return 0;
        HashMap<Character, Integer> index = new HashMap<>();
        int left = 0;
        int right = 0;
        int maxLen = 0;
        while(right < s.length())
        {
            if(index.size() <= 2)
            {
                char c = s.charAt(right);
                index.put(c, right);
                right++;
            }
            
            if(index.size() > 2)
            {
                int leftMost = s.length();
                for(Integer i : index.values())
                {
                    leftMost = Math.min(leftMost, i);
                }
                char c = s.charAt(leftMost);
                index.remove(c);
                left = leftMost + 1;
            }
            maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, right - left);
        }
        return maxLen;
    }
}
```
