# 105. Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal



Given preorder and inorder traversal of a tree, construct the binary tree.

**Note:**  
You may assume that duplicates do not exist in the tree.

For example, given

```text
preorder = [3,9,20,15,7]
inorder = [9,3,15,20,7]
```

Return the following binary tree:

```text
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```

The basic idea is here: Say we have 2 arrays, PRE and IN. Preorder traversing implies that PRE\[0\] is the root node. Then we can find this PRE\[0\] in IN, say it's IN\[5\]. Now we know that IN\[5\] is root, so we know that IN\[0\] - IN\[4\] is on the left side, IN\[6\] to the end is on the right side. Recursively doing this on subarrays, we can build a tree out of it :\)

```java
public TreeNode buildTree(int[] preorder, int[] inorder) {
    return helper(0, 0, inorder.length - 1, preorder, inorder);
}

public TreeNode helper(int preStart, int inStart, int inEnd, int[] preorder, int[] inorder) {
    if (preStart > preorder.length - 1 || inStart > inEnd) {
        return null;
    }
    TreeNode root = new TreeNode(preorder[preStart]);
    int inIndex = 0; // Index of current root in inorder
    for (int i = inStart; i <= inEnd; i++) {
        if (inorder[i] == root.val) {
            inIndex = i;
        }
    }
    root.left = helper(preStart + 1, inStart, inIndex - 1, preorder, inorder);
    root.right = helper(preStart + inIndex - inStart + 1, inIndex + 1, inEnd, preorder, inorder);
    return root;
}
```

时间复杂度：O\(N\*logN\) ??  空间复杂度：O\(N\)

Space: O\(N\) Because each node we create a helper\(\), the recursion stack will cost O\(N\)

Time: O\(N log N\) for a balanced tree, O\(N^2\) for a skew tree  
As mentioned above, the helper\(\) runs O\(N\) time, and for each helper\(\), there is a for-loop to search the inorder index.

For a balanced tree, the range of the search will be reduced by half each time, so the search costs O\(log n\)  
Therefore the time is O\(N\) \* O\(log N\) = O\(N log N\)

For a skew tree, the range of the search will only be reduced by 1, so the search still costs O\(N\)  
Therefore the time is O\(N\) \* O\(N\) = O\(N^2\)
