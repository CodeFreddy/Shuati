# 187. Repeated DNA Sequences



All DNA is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as A, C, G, and T, for example: "ACGAATTCCG". When studying DNA, it is sometimes useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.

Write a function to find all the 10-letter-long sequences \(substrings\) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule.

**Example:**

```text
Input: s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT"

Output: ["AAAAACCCCC", "CCCCCAAAAA"]
```

```java
class Solution {
    public List<String> findRepeatedDnaSequences(String s) {
        Set<String> seen = new HashSet<>();
        Set<String> repeated = new HashSet<>();
        for(int i = 0; i + 9 < s.length(); i++)
        {
            String temp = s.substring(i, i+10);
            if(!seen.add(temp))
                repeated.add(temp);
        }
        return new ArrayList<>(repeated);
    }
}
```

时间复杂度： O\(n\)  where n is length of input string s.  while loop runs O\(n\) times and substring method O\(m\) where is m is length of substring it is not O\(n^2\) as you think, because the subString method is O\(1\) because m = 10 is constant. 

空间复杂度：  Space is O\(p\) where p is total number of subSequences
