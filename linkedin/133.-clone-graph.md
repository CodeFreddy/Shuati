# 133. Clone Graph

Given the head of a graph, return a deep copy \(clone\) of the graph. Each node in the graph contains a `label` \(`int`\) and a list \(`List[UndirectedGraphNode]`\) of its `neighbors`. There is an edge between the given node and each of the nodes in its neighbors.  
**OJ's undirected graph serialization \(so you can understand error output\):**

Nodes are labeled uniquely.We use `#` as a separator for each node, and `,` as a separator for node label and each neighbor of the node.

As an example, consider the serialized graph `{0,1,2#1,2#2,2}`.

The graph has a total of three nodes, and therefore contains three parts as separated by `#`.

1. First node is labeled as `0`. Connect node `0` to both nodes `1` and `2`.
2. Second node is labeled as `1`. Connect node `1` to node `2`.
3. Third node is labeled as `2`. Connect node `2` to node `2` \(itself\), thus forming a self-cycle.

Visually, the graph looks like the following:

```text
       1
      / \
     /   \
    0 --- 2
         / \
         \_/
```

**Note**: The information about the tree serialization is only meant so that you can understand error output if you get a wrong answer. You don't need to understand the serialization to solve the problem.



解法1： DFS 时间复杂度：O\(m+n\) m: number of nodes, n: number of edges 空间复杂度:O\(n\)

```java
/**
 * Definition for undirected graph.
 * class UndirectedGraphNode {
 *     int label;
 *     List<UndirectedGraphNode> neighbors;
 *     UndirectedGraphNode(int x) { label = x; neighbors = new ArrayList<UndirectedGraphNode>(); }
 * };
 */
public class Solution {
    private   HashMap<UndirectedGraphNode, UndirectedGraphNode> map = new HashMap<>();
    public UndirectedGraphNode cloneGraph(UndirectedGraphNode node) {
        return helper(node);
    }
    
    private UndirectedGraphNode helper(UndirectedGraphNode node)
    {
        if(node == null) return null;
        if(map.containsKey(node)) return map.get(node);
        UndirectedGraphNode dup = new UndirectedGraphNode(node.label);
        map.put(node, dup);
        for(UndirectedGraphNode neighbor: node.neighbors)
        {
            UndirectedGraphNode newNode = helper(neighbor);
            dup.neighbors.add(newNode);
        }
        return dup;
    }
}
```

解法2： BFS 时间复杂度和空进复杂度和dfs一样

```java
/**
 * Definition for undirected graph.
 * class UndirectedGraphNode {
 *     int label;
 *     List<UndirectedGraphNode> neighbors;
 *     UndirectedGraphNode(int x) { label = x; neighbors = new ArrayList<UndirectedGraphNode>(); }
 * };
 */
public class Solution {
    private HashMap<UndirectedGraphNode, UndirectedGraphNode> map = new HashMap<>();
    public UndirectedGraphNode cloneGraph(UndirectedGraphNode node) {
        if(node == null) return null;
        List<UndirectedGraphNode> nodes = getNodes(node);
        for(UndirectedGraphNode old: nodes)
        {
            map.put(old, new UndirectedGraphNode(old.label));
        }
        
        for(UndirectedGraphNode old: nodes)
        {
            UndirectedGraphNode newNode = map.get(old);
            for(UndirectedGraphNode neighbor: old.neighbors)
            {
                newNode.neighbors.add(map.get(neighbor));
            }
        }
        return map.get(node);
    }
    
    private List<UndirectedGraphNode> getNodes(UndirectedGraphNode node)
    {
        Queue<UndirectedGraphNode> q = new LinkedList<>();
        HashSet<UndirectedGraphNode> hash = new HashSet<>();
        q.offer(node);
        hash.add(node);
        while(!q.isEmpty())
        {
            UndirectedGraphNode cur = q.poll();
            for(UndirectedGraphNode neighbor: cur.neighbors)
            {
                if(!hash.contains(neighbor))
                {
                    hash.add(neighbor);
                    q.offer(neighbor);
                }
            }
                
        }
        return new ArrayList<>(hash);
    }
}
```
