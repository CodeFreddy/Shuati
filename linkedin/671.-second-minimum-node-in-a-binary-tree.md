# 671. Second Minimum Node In a Binary Tree



Given a non-empty special binary tree consisting of nodes with the non-negative value, where each node in this tree has exactly `two` or `zero` sub-node. If the node has two sub-nodes, then this node's value is the smaller value among its two sub-nodes.

Given such a binary tree, you need to output the **second minimum** value in the set made of all the nodes' value in the whole tree.

If no such second minimum value exists, output -1 instead.

**Example 1:**  


```text
Input: 
    2
   / \
  2   5
     / \
    5   7

Output: 5
Explanation: The smallest value is 2, the second smallest value is 5.
```

**Example 2:**  


```text
Input: 
    2
   / \
  2   2

Output: -1
Explanation: The smallest value is 2, but there isn't any second smallest value.
```



 for left and right sub-node, if their value is the same with the parent node value, need to using recursion to find the next candidate, otherwise use their node value as the candidate.

时间复杂度:o\(n\) n is the number of node in the tree.

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public int findSecondMinimumValue(TreeNode root) {
        if(root == null) return -1;
        if(root.left == null && root.right == null) return -1;
        
        int left = root.left.val;
        int right = root.right.val;
        
        if(root.left.val == root.val)
            left = findSecondMinimumValue(root.left);
        if(root.right.val == root.val)
            right = findSecondMinimumValue(root.right);
        if(left != -1 && right != -1)
            return Math.min(left, right);
        else if(left != -1)
            return left;
        else
            return right;
    }
}
```
