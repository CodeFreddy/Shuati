# 323. Number of Connected Components in an Undirected Graph

Given `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1` and a list of undirected edges \(each edge is a pair of nodes\), write a function to find the number of connected components in an undirected graph.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: n = 5 and edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [3, 4]]

     0          3
     |          |
     1 --- 2    4 

Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: n = 5 and edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]]

     0           4
     |           |
     1 --- 2 --- 3

Output:  1
```

**Note:**  
You can assume that no duplicate edges will appear in `edges`. Since all edges are undirected, `[0, 1]` is the same as `[1, 0]` and thus will not appear together in `edges`.

 the time complexity will be \(N + M\)\*lgN. M is the number is unions in the array, and N is the number of nodes.

```java
class Solution {
    public int countComponents(int n, int[][] edges) {
        int[] nodes = new int[n];
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            nodes[i] = i;
        for(int[] edge: edges)
        {
            int root1 = find(nodes, edge[0]);
            int root2 = find(nodes, edge[1]);
            if(root1 != root2)
            {
                nodes[root1] = root2;
                n--;
            }
            
        }
        return n;
    }
    
    private int find(int[] nodes, int x)
    {
        if(nodes[x] == x)
            return x;
        return nodes[x] = find(nodes, nodes[x]);
    }
}
```
